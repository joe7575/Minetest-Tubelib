# Tube Library

Minetest Tube Mod for item exchange via lumber tubes and wireless message communication between nodes.

The focus for this Mod are:
- minimized server load and thus minimized server lags
- simple and intuitive usage for players
- simple API for programmers

The mod provides:
- lumber tubes to connect 2 nodes
- a Pusher node to pull/push items through tubes
- a Distributor node with 4 output channels to sort incoming items
- a Blackhole node which lets all items disappear (example/template for programmers)
- a Button/switch node to send "switch on/off" messages
- a Lamp node as receiving example for message communication
- support for default node: furnace and chests
